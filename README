# TSV Custom Locale Plugin

A simple plugin designed to override specific translations in an OJS (Open Journal Systems) installation.

With this plugin, you can easily define custom translations by creating a customLocale.po file. This file should be placed in a directory structured by the Context ID (Journal ID) and target locale. For example: customLocale/1/en_US/customLocale.po. You can have several of these files for different Contexts and locales.
